# Implement Closures

In this activity you will work on this user story:

* As a developer, I want to demonstrate my knowledge of closures by creating a `makeCountDown` function that accesses the surrounding function state.

## Your Task

* It's done when I have created a function `makeCountDown` that returns a nested function.

* It's done when I have set the return value of `countDown` to a variable called `countingDown`. 

* It's done when invoking the `countingDown` for the first time will start a countdown from `startingNum`.

* It's done when every subsequent invocation of `countDown` returns the `startingNum` subtracted from the `decreasedBy` variable.


## Notes

* Refer to the [MDN Documentation on Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures#closure)

## Hints

* How can we use the comments inside `index.js` to guide us in what our inner function should return?

* What kind of function is one that creates other functions?

## Bonus

* Using Google, what are some complications you might run into when using closures within for loops?
