# Access Data from Lexical Scope

In this activity you will work on this user story:

* As a developer, I want to understand lexical scoping by creating a function that accesses the surrounding state.

## Your Task

* It's done when I have opened `index.js` and modified the function so that it returns another function.

* It's done when the nested function logs out the `name` variable.

* It's done when I assign the return value of the outer function to another variable called `myFunction`.

* It's done when I have invoked `myFunction()` and ensured that the results appear in the developer console.

## Hints

* How can the definition of lexical scope help guide our understanding oh this activity?

* [Wikipedia Definition of Lexical Scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scope)
