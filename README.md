# Javascript Closures in-depth

## Overview

This lesson plan goes over Javascript closures which can at first seem like a confusing and complex concept to students. The good news is, they are very simple once you wrap your head around them. 

This lesson plan contains three student activities accompanied by a review after each. Before each student activity we will introduce the students to the topic with a short 5 minute demonstration.

## Notes for Instructional Staff

* Please be ready to open the `index.html` file enclosed in each demo and activity and open the developer tools for your given browser. This can often be accessed by right clicking anywhere on the page, choosing "inspect element" and then clicking on the "console" tab from there.

* Start small with closures and be aware that this can be a relatively difficult concept for students to grasp at first.

* It is important to note that Javascript behaves differently than other programming languages when it comes to handling scope. If any students are coming from a background in another programming language, it may be beneficial to point this out to prevent incorrect assumptions about the topic.
