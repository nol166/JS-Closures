# Javascript Closures in-depth

## Overview

This lesson plan goes over Javascript closures which can at first seem like a confusing and complex concept to students. The good news is, they are very simple once you wrap your head around them. 

This lesson plan contains three student activities accompanied by a review after each. Before each student activity we will introduce the students to the topic with a short 5 minute demonstration.

## Notes for Instructional Staff

* Please be ready to open the `index.html` file enclosed in each demo and activity and open the developer tools for your given browser. This can often be accessed by right clicking anywhere on the page, choosing "inspect element" and then clicking on the "console" tab from there.

* Start small with closures and be aware that this can be a relatively difficult concept for students to grasp at first.

* It is important to note that Javascript behaves differently than other programming languages when it comes to handling scope. If any students are coming from a background in another programming language, it may be beneficial to point this out to prevent incorrect assumptions about the topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* @TODO Bullet the learning objectives for the lesson plan. Refer to your Activity Planner.

* @TODO When writing learning objectives, start each one with a measurable verb. Refer to this [list of measurable verbs used to assess learning outcomes](https://www.clinton.edu/curriculumcommittee/listofmeasurableverbs.cxml). For example, "Initialize projects and install third-party packages using npm."

* @TODO If a learning objective is a concept and not a demonstrable skill, use the verb "explain". For example, "Explain the client-server model."

* @TODO Do not use the verb "understand" because it is not measurable.

* @TODO Aim for 3&ndash;6 learning objectives. If you find yourself listing more than six, you may need to rethink the scope of your objectives or the lesson itself.
